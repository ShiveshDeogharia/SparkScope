Reducing Transport Emissions:

- Use electric vehicles for short-distance delivery.
- Switch to rail over long-haul trucking where possible.
- Consolidate shipments to reduce freight kilometers.
- Train drivers on efficient driving practices (acceleration, braking).
- Use GPS route optimization to minimize idling.
